# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub
As a professional I am a business analyst and graphic designer with minimal hands on coding experience. 
By joining GitHub, my intention is to grow and develope a more sturctural coding skillset that will not only allow for better communication to my developers but also allow me to explore my own personal ideas as an entraprenuer. 
I am eager to get my hands dirty and my mind exploded!
